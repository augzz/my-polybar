# My Polybar Config
This is my [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) configuration runnning on Linux Mint. Scripts included. Updated now with [themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) (currently using Docky style) using [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) for color pallette generation based on wallpaper. Customized modules include a window toggle (launch, minimize or maximize) instead of just launching the window.

## Modules
- Search
- Workspaces
- Apps (toggle)
- CPU
- RAM
- Spotify player
- Minimized apps
- System tray
- Network
- Sound
